# Intensity profile:
Code used to measure intensity profile of expanded beam using Basler CMOS camera using multiple images of different exposure

# Phase encoding SPIM:
Function to obtain phase values for pixels from a given spin arrangement and interaction matrix of Ising Hamiltonian

# Beam_comp.py:
Gives phase mapping for gaussian beam corrected mattis interactions on SLM

# TODO:
1. Phase to greyscale mapper (update CLUT in HOLOEYE Config)
2. Simulated Annealing feedback loop
3. Integrate intensity measurement using camera to calculate hamiltonian optically
